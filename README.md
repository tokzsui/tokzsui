With Docker
The Docker image provided will create a Teampass installation in its /var/www/html/ directory, which you should mount as a volume to keep persistent. SSL is not provided if you use this image without a proxy in front of it. See the included Docker Compose file for an example setup.

Note: Use /var/www/html/sk as your "Absolute path to saltkey" during installation.

With Docker Compose
The included docker-compose.yml file is an example setup, using virtual host-based reverse proxy routing to provide SSL. If you want to use the Compose file as-is, you will need to provide an SSL certificate with a CN matching the teampass service's VIRTUAL_HOST variable. See the documentation for the jwilder/nginx-proxy image for details. In short, you'll need to put your certificate file (with extension .crt, e.g. teampass.domain.local.crt) and the according private key file (with extension .key, e.g. teampass.domain.local.key) into the directory ssl, named exactly after the FQDN you put into the VIRTUAL_HOST variable. Make sure to restart the nginx service after changes to the certificate or at least signal it with the reload command: docker-compose exec nginx nginx -s reload.

Note1: The database's hostname is db. You can find the database's credentials in the environment variables of the db service.

Note2: Use /var/www/html/sk as your "Absolute path to saltkey" during installation.
